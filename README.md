# IBM_DVWP_PROJECT-US_Domestic_Airline_Flights_Performance

I did this project for IBM Data Visualization With Python Course in coursera. I created a dashboard using plotly and dash

Initially the dashboard will be empty

When we select input, the corresponding reports are provided.We can have two reports(Airline Performance and Delay Reports).

## The Airline Performnance Report

It has a treemap(Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline), pie chart(Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline), usa map(Number of flights flying from each state), bar chart(Number of flights under different cancellation categories), line chart(Average flight time by reporting airline)

## The Airline Delay Report

It contains line charts showing average carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft delay times
